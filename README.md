## Design Patterns


This repo contains short code examples that explore or illustrate some
interesting idea or pattern. These examples are not meant to be
industrial-strength, ready-to-use libraries - instead it tries to convey an idea
as simply as possible. There's no error-checking, namespaces, header files,
header guards or any of the things you expect from a library.

The code compiles on Ubuntu 18.04 using clang version 11.0.0 with libc++ as the
default standard library.
